### Data Description

The dataset shows the reported incidents of crime that have occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present. This data comes from the Chicago Police Department CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Potential users for this dataset include law enforcement agencies, researchers, policymakers, and the general public. This dataset could help understand crime trends and hotspots within the city. Users can explore correlations between crime rates and various factors. This dataset includes 7.89 million rows and 22 columns. Some of the information included in this dataset are the block (address), the reporting code, shows if there was an arrest, whether it was a domestic crime, which community area it occurred in, the coordinates, and many more. The dataset was created back in 2011 and is regularly updated with the most recent data on a daily basis. 

The dataset's field names, descriptions, and data types are as follows:

## Summary

Domain Questions - 
Does Chicago’s seasonality changes alter the output or type of crime committed? The reasoning stems from the fact that Chicago is no stranger to extreme and harsh winters. Curiosity from our group stems from the notion that crime might change by their commonality and nature due to these weather conditions. For example, do we see more theft in the Winter than the summer because those who are stealing might be impoverished and need to stay warm. We can assess where these more impoverished areas might be as we have access to location data as well. This is one aspect of criminal data that we really want to inspect.

Is there a correlation between the time of day and the amount of crime in the city? - We would like to research the pattern behind when crimes are occurring most often in the city. One of the attributes in the dataset is the date and time that any crime occurred. We believe most cities deal with heavy crime when it is darker and there are less witnesses around. This is something we would like to research into. Our group is curious in understanding which times of the day are the most dangerous as this would also help us as we venture into the city to be cautious.

How heavily is crime concentrated within the city of Chicago and are particular types of crime heavily concentrated within particular blocks? There have been various attempts of gentrification of certain neighborhoods around Chicago. This yearns the question of whether certain areas of the city are termed as hotspots of crime, places that people should avoid. There are also several crimes that take place unknown to the general public. Only on further probing, will we be able to see if crime is still concentrated in particular areas of the city. It is also interesting to note the impacts of gentrification and whether there has been a prominent difference in the number as well as severity of crimes in those areas.

Are there certain crimes that most often end in an arrest and do arrests happen more frequently in specific areas of the city? Additionally, is crime location a factor in this and how has it changed over time? There is a curiosity surrounding which types of crimes most often end in arrests (if at all). If the crime-arrest correlation reveals that there is indeed a high rate of arrest, the analysis can be extended further to see if the location of crime impacts the outcome. Looking into this would enable us to see potential trends in crimes and arrests as they vary by location. The arrest rate is a helpful metric to study because it is possible that it could be an indicator for what types of crimes are likely to start occurring more/less frequently. For example, if we study the “Criminal Damage” rates and the arrest rate for that crime, it could reveal the effectiveness of arrests for that crime, if at all. Ideally, we are trying to leverage the use of the “Arrest” column to gauge the effectiveness of arrests for certain crimes and reveal trends in various areas of the city.


The implemented visualizations were derived from our logic from Assignment 1 where we wanted to cover as much ground as possible. Therefore, our visualizations aim to describe aspects of temporal and spatial analysis, statistic driven insights, and possible behavioral details regarding Crime data. Topics such as, but not limited to, how seasonality affects crime occurrence, what neighborhoods host the most crimes, at what time of day do we see the most crimes occur, and ratio of Arrest/Non-Arrest percentages are types of visualizations we think would describe our dataset thoroughly. For the visualizations just mentioned, the insights were as follows:

Seasonality: There was not much difference between crime occurrence per crime per season to state with certainty that seasonality affects crime output
Neighborhoods: There were particular neighborhoods which showed higher spikes especially within the West neighborhoods which also translates to the Arrests within the same neighborhoods. There were also a lesser number of reported crimes within the south side neighborhoods of Chicago, which might not always be the right numbers with regards to reported crimes and actual number of crimes within such neighborhoods.
Time of Day: There were certain crimes such as Theft and Battery that were most common during the night time. In addition, theft was common throughout the day as there are many situations where you can get robbed. Lastly, alley ways were the most common for crime out of all of the locations.
Arrest Rates: Every crime either resulted in an arrest (or not). There were patterns and obvious trends that varied over the course of a 24-hour period. It was noticeable that there were lulls in arrests from 3am - 6am. This picks up a little from 11am to 7pm but Narcotic arrests increase drastically at 12pm and 10pm.

### Visualizations

Angad: For the Linked View visualization, I wanted to expand upon this Line chart. I still wanted to look at how crime has changed over time but I wanted curiosity of looking at a particular crime to be the driver of my linked view. So, one can click on the legend of different crimes to get a filtered, focused view on a crime that will, when selected, will gray out the other crime types on the line chart. In addition, there is a stacked bar chart below that originally encompasses all crime types, but when a certain crime is selected, it turns into a regular bar chart of just that crime.

Sarvani: For the linked view visualization I created three different charts that were able to be altered based on an interaction where users could select different years. The first chart is the bar chart which shows the count of crime per type. The second chart is a pie chart that shows the distribution of crimes by time category for any given year. The last chart is a horizontal bar chart that shows the count of crime per each block.

Steven: This linked view visualization is an insight into both data displayed in the line chart as well as data not directly displayed within the graph. The chart queries by the type of crime and shows the amount of arrests that occur over the course of a 24-hour day. When a query is made, the pie chart updates to show the proportion of arrests/non-arrests for that crime. This is useful for a user because some arrests more often end in arrests whereas some do not. While the line charts shows the arrests counts over the course of the day, we can also get an intuitive sense for the potential amount of non-arrests happening for a specific crime.

Nandana: I wanted to see how the number of crimes that were being reported could be compared to the number of arrests. Also within the span of the years from 2000-2023, were there certain types of crime that witnessed a larger number of arrests? The two plots that I linked together was a scatter plot and a barchart. The user can drage a brush or a rectangle around the scatter plot which will highlight the barchart to only plot those values. The scatter plot shows the trends over the years in the number of arrests for various types of crime whereas the bar chart shows the number of crimes for top 5 types of crimes and change depending on the area selected as a method of interaction with the user.
